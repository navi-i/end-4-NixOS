work for you. 

# Installation
## Installing the whole system
Follow the following steps(Please file a bug if it doesn't work) - 
1. Change the hosts/<username>/hardware-configuration.nix with your own
2. Change the name of folders inside home/ and hosts/ to your own username
3. Change the username, home-manager username and hostname in `./homes/default.nix`, `./hosts/default.nix` & if it
